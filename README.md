A 4WD differential-drive robot running ROS 2 Humble that detects pickleballs on a court, navigates to them, picks them up with an onboard 6-DOF arm, and returns them to a base station — all while staying outside the court boundary so it doesn't get stepped on.

The original v1 platform paired a Raspberry Pi 4 with a Teensy 4.1 (motor/encoder/IMU via [linorobot2](https://github.com/linorobot/linorobot2)), an RPLIDAR A1, and a USB webcam. The v2 redesign in progress swaps in a Jetson Orin Nano Super, a DOFBOT-SE 6-DOF arm, and an rpicam3.

**Status**: v2 in active development. See:

### v2 additions (in progress)

- Jetson Orin Nano Super (compute upgrade)
- DOFBOT-SE 6-DOF arm + gripper (manipulation)
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 (CSI, replacing the USB webcam)

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full v2 hardware story including the open question on whether to bypass the DOFBOT STM32 expansion board and drive it directly over I2C from the Orin.

## Development

The project builds and runs in the VSCode devcontainers under `.devcontainer/`. Pick the variant matching your host:

- `linux-gpu/` — Linux host with NVIDIA GPU
- `wsl-gpu/` — WSL 2 with GPU passthrough

For GPU passthrough you'll first need the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).
